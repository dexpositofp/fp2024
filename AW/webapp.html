            <h2>The Internet. The Web</h2>
            <p>The Internet is a global network that connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks.</p> 
            <p>It allows information sharing and communication across different devices worldwide. The Web, also known as the World Wide Web (WWW), is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that can be accessed through the Internet.</p>

            <h2>Connecting to the Internet. ISP and Types of Service</h2>
            <p>To access the Internet, you need an Internet Service Provider (ISP). </p>
            <p>ISPs provide different types of services such as broadband, fiber, satellite, and mobile data. Each service varies in speed, cost, and availability depending on your location.</p>

            <h2>The Cloud and Web Apps</h2>
            <p>The Cloud refers to online storage and computing services that allow users to store data and run applications over the Internet instead of on local devices. </p>
            <p>Some of the most widely used cloud services are <span class="resaltar">Microsoft Azure</span>, <span class="resaltar">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</span>, and <span class="resaltar">Google Cloud Platform</span>. </p>
            <p>These services offer powerful tools for web hosting, data storage, and running web apps from any device with Internet access.</p>
            <h3>Deep Dive into Cloud Services:</h3>
            <p>Let's take a closer look at the three major cloud service providers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microsoft Azure:</strong> Offers a range of cloud services, including virtual machines, app services, and storage solutions. Azure is known for its integration with Microsoft products like Office 365 and Windows Server, making it a popular choice for businesses familiar with Microsoft tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS):</strong> One of the largest cloud providers, AWS offers services like Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Storage Service (S3), and Lambda for serverless computing. AWS provides scalable and flexible solutions for businesses of all sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP):</strong> Focuses on data analytics, machine learning, and cloud computing. GCP offers BigQuery for large-scale data analysis and TensorFlow for machine learning models. Google Cloud is widely used by tech companies and startups.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each cloud provider has its strengths, and selecting the right one depends on your business needs.</p> For example, a company looking for seamless integration with Microsoft products might choose Azure, while a startup focused on data analysis may prefer Google Cloud.</p>
            <h3>Research Task:</h3>
            <h4>Cloud Solution Proposal for a Small Business</h4>
            <p>For this task, imagine you are advising a small retail business with 50 employees. The business requires a cloud solution to handle their e-commerce, customer relationship management (CRM), and internal document storage systems. Your job is to research the cloud services offered by Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud and propose a cloud solution that meets the company’s needs.</p>
            <p>Consider the following factors:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cost: The company has a monthly budget of <strong>$1,500</strong> for cloud services.</li>
             <li>Ease of use: The solution should be easy to manage for a small IT team with limited experience in cloud technologies.</li>
             <li>Scalability: The company plans to grow in the next 3-5 years, so the cloud solution should be scalable.</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Prepare a <strong>4-minute presentation</strong> summarizing your proposal and justifying your choice of cloud provider. Be sure to include a comparison of Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each in relation to the company's needs.</p>
        <p>You will present this in the next class.</p>

            <h2>Browsing: Hyperlinks, Search Engines, and URLs</h2>
            <p>Browsing the web involves using hyperlinks to navigate between web pages. Search engines, like Google, help users find information by typing keywords. URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are the addresses of web pages that allow users to access specific websites.</p>
            <h3>Advanced Search Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use quotation marks to search for an exact phrase (e.g., <span class="resaltar">"web development basics"</span>).</li>
                <li>Use a minus sign (-) to exclude certain terms from your search (e.g., <span class="resaltar">Python tutorials -Java</span>).</li>
                <li>Use <span class="resaltar">site:</span> to search within a specific website (e.g., <span class="resaltar">site:wikipedia.org Python</span>).</li>
                <li>Use <span class="resaltar">filetype:</span> to search for specific types of files (e.g., <span class="resaltar">web design filetype:pdf</span>).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Practice Exercises:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Search for resources about "responsive web design" excluding results related to JavaScript.</li>
                <li>Find PDF documents about "web development" from any educational website (use <span class="resaltar">site:.edu</span>).</li>
                <li>Search for articles on Wikipedia about HTML5.</li>
                <li>Find exact information about "cloud computing services" using quotation marks in your search.</li>
                <li>Look for Word documents (.doc or .docx) on "CSS best practices".</li>
                <!-- Advanced Exercises -->
                <li>Search for academic papers in PDF format about "machine learning" excluding results related to neural networks.</li>
                <li>Find Excel files (.xls or .xlsx) with data about "e-commerce sales" on government websites.</li>
                <li>Look for presentation slides in PowerPoint format (.ppt or .pptx) about "cybersecurity best practices".</li>
                <li>Search for images related to "web design trends" and restrict results to high-resolution images.</li>
                <li>Find academic articles on "AI in education" published in the last year.</li>
            </ol>
